Outstanding tasks:
- (breadbox) How should mouse events be handled?
- (breadbox) How should textures be handled?
  - Textures should be handled as their own thing. Geometry contains texcoords, however it is up to the prop whether we have a texture to work with or not. ~Alex
- (breadbox) Where to start with sound?
- (breadbox) How should motion interpolation be implemented?
  - Maybe we can use something similar to what we have for the camera? Simply have fields such as the object's position that we generate a matrix with. Then we can have a second for where we predict it will be and interpolate that way for smooth rendering. ~Alex
- (breadbox) How does the HUD fit into all of this?
- (win32-d3d) Create a backend for Windows machines

Known Issues:
- (unix-glx) Some window managers simply unmap windows rather than destroying them.
  - ICCCM support has been added, but the engine keeps running when the window is closed. What did I do wrong this time? ~Alex
