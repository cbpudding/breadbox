Outstanding tasks:
- (breadbox) How should mouse events be handled?
- (breadbox) How should textures be handled?
  - Textures should be handled as their own thing. Geometry contains texcoords, however it is up to the prop whether we have a texture to work with or not. ~Alex
- (breadbox) Where to start with sound?

Known Issues:
- (unix-glx) Some window managers simply unmap windows rather than destroying them.
  - ICCCM support has been added, but the engine keeps running when the window is closed. What did I do wrong this time? ~Alex
