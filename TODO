Outstanding tasks:
- (breadbox) What is the best way to represent game objects in the model?
- (breadbox) How should resources be handled? This may largely depend on how the model represents objects.
- (breadbox) How should inputs be mapped to events? I would hate to statically assign buttons to axes/triggers.

Known Issues:
- (unix-glx) Some window managers simply unmap windows rather than destroying them.
  - ICCCM support has been added, although it is currently untested. Is this fixed? ~Alex
